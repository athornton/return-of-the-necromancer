<h3 id="org9c99430">First port: Frotz for TOPS-20</h3>
<p>
Frotz is an interpreter for Infocom-format Z-machine games.  This
includes the released Infocom games&#x2013;Zorks 1-3, Planetfall, The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Trinity, et cetera.
</p>

<p>
It also includes the post-Infocom Z-machine games: Curses, Anchorhead,
et al.  Z5 existed in the real Infocom world (Trinity, Beyond Zork,
Solid Gold).  Z8 is purely post-commercial.
</p>

</section>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgf307dd1">Why Frotz?</h3>
<p>
I maintain the Linux CLI port of Inform 7; dumb-frotz is the test
harness there, so I knew it reasonably well.  The dumb-frotz port does
not require a cursor-addressible terminal, which meant I wasn't going to
have to find or write a curses layer for my target systems.
</p>

<p>
It's ANSI C (almost), and pretty straightforward.
</p>

</section>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orga1dd60c">Why TOPS-20?</h3>
<p>
Infocom used a TOPS-20 system as their development system once they went
commercial.  Mark Crispin (RIP) created a lovely TOPS-20 distribution,
Pandas, which includes an ANSI C compiler and a lot of Unix
accommodation support.  This plus the KLH-10 emulator made getting a
development environment pretty easy, and setting up TCP/IP on TOPS-20
wasn't too difficult; thus getting files in and out was almost
straightforward.
</p>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org44e2a76">Why not ITS?</h3>
<p>
Because ITS sucks.
</p>

<p>
Sure, it'd be nice to bring the Z-machine games <span class="underline">all the way</span> back
home.  But the C compiler is slightly pre-K&amp;R and the overall
environment is something I find just excruciating.
</p>

<p>
Lars Brinkhoff and David Griffith may be working on this.

<h4 id="org047f21f">9-bit bytes</h4>
<p>
The Z-machine looks a lot like a PDP-11: 16-bit word, 64K addressible
memory (z5 and z8 basically just stretch the alignment, allowing more
ROM text, but not doing a lot with the writeable memory of the
Z-machine).  The host machine is 36-bit with 9-bit chars.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org79c1469">The linker</h4>
<p>
You've only got six characters, effectively, for a symbol.  Modern
applications do not typically have only-six-character function names.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org138043a">We'll start with the linker</h3>
<p>
This is the easier problem.  If the function names are too long&#x2026;make
them shorter.  Write a source code preprocessor:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/athornton/gnusto-frotz-tops20">https://github.com/athornton/gnusto-frotz-tops20</a>
</p>

<p>
I used Perl, because for line-at-a-time text parsing and regex
substitution, it still beats the hell out of Python.

<h3 id="org090ed66">Once you've done that&#x2026;.</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/athornton/tops20-frotz">https://github.com/athornton/tops20-frotz</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/athornton/tops20-frotz/blob/master/urbzig.sed">urbzig.sed</a> contains the symbol remappings.
</p>

<p>
Then you get to tackle the hard part.
</p>

<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgf97d420">Nine-bit bytes</h3>
<p>
From the Dumb-Frotz README, in CAVEATS:
</p>

<p>
lack of 8-bit char and 16-bit short.  I didn't bother to think
much about this.  If you're using a 36-bit Honeywell or
something, let me know.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgfe42bf3">In practice, not that bad</h3>
<p>
Turn macros back into functions for easier debugging.
</p>

<p>
Do a lot of &amp;0xFF and &amp;0xFFFF.
</p>

<p>
There are a few places with pointer arithmetic that you need to be
careful with.
</p>

<p>
Frotz has a decent test suite, so it was an iterative process to see
which opcodes were failing and then a matter of tracing the flow and
figuring out where the failure in the opcode is.

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgb87bdbd">And now it works</h3>
<p>
All the V3-V8 games run.  Those that need fancy display capabilities
(Jigsaw, Beyond Zork, some of the stunt games) don't work so great, of
course.
</p>

<h3 id="org6a906be">Second port: ZIP for 2.11BSD</h3>
<p>
Another Z-machine interpreter, put together for my annual Elvis party.
</p>

<p>
Zork I was actually released for RSX-11, and I think there's a
reasonable RSX-11M+ interpreter for most games, but I wanted it to be
Unix.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org2a761c9">What's hard here?</h3>
<p>
The hard part is that the PDP-11 is not actually bigger than the
Z-Machine.  This isn't a problem per se.  The whole point of the
Z-machine was to let you implement a 16-bit virtual machine on an 8-bit
micro.
</p>

<p>
But I didn't have time or desire to write a tight little Z-code terp in
PDP-11 assembly.  And anyway those were generally only v3 interpreters,
and I wanted at least v5 games to work.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orge3e0f8e">Where to start?</h3>
<p>
Modern Z-terps assume that there's plenty of system memory available: no
need to do paging and memory is at least 32 addressible bits.  So I had
to go back to a DOS-era interpreter to find something that didn't make
those incorrect assumptions.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org4861b56">ZIP.  No, not that one.</h3>
<p>
I ended with the Zmachine InterPreter, ZIP (named before the archive
format), now called "zterp" for obvious reasons
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/athornton/pdp11-zterp">https://github.com/athornton/pdp11-zterp</a>
</p>

<p>
The only changes I remember needing were some linker flags to use split
instruction and data spaces.
</p>

<p>
A few of the bigger Z5 games still don't run, but most games do.
</p>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org9099428">Third port: Forth for v7</h3>
<p>
I started with Leif Bruder's Forth:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/lbruder/10007431">https://gist.github.com/lbruder/10007431</a>
</p>

<p>
It's a single-file C program, ANSI C.  It builds cleanly on 2.11 BSD.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org3d61108">Ah, but v7</h3>
<p>
So, there are a few problems.  The six-character symbol thing is back in
effect.  That's tractable.
</p>

<p>
The C compiler is K&amp;R, not ANSI.  That too is tractable; mostly
unprotoizing functions, and there was a concatenation macro that I
needed to fiddle with.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgad529a7">But still not success</h3>
<p>
So now I can get all the functions to compile, but the linker is angry
because either (if I leave it as one file) there are too many symbols,
or (if I break the functions into individual files) there are too many
files.  I'm fairly confident there is a happy medium here somewhere, but
I haven't put in the time to find it.  The v7 linker is fragile and does
not have good error messages.
</p>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org46a7fbd">v7 as a Daily Driver</h3>
<p>
I'm not <b>really</b> suggesting doing this, but&#x2026;how close to usable is a
v7 system?
</p>

<p>
Let's assume that "editing, compiling, and running C files and shell
scripts" is much of what you need on a day-to-day basis.
</p>

<p>
There are two things obviously wrong with v7 for that out of the box: no
screen editor, and no networking, so no easy way to get a file into the
v7 environment for editing.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgd6d36d2">Screen Editor</h3>
<p>
Webb Miller wrote <span class="underline">A Software Tools Sampler</span> in 1987.  It includes a
little vi-sorta-alike called s.  This can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/udo-munk/s/">https://github.com/udo-munk/s/</a>.
</p>

<p>
It took a little hacking to make work under v7, but not much (I don't
remember the details, alas).  It still doesn't work reliably on large
files, and the screen handling can be a little funny, but&#x2026;basically it
works like vi.  Which is no emacs, but is better than ed, for sure.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org6f97c0e">Getting files into v7</h3>
<p>
There's a trivial and lame way.  I use iTerm2 on the Mac.  It has a
"paste slowly" option.
</p>

<p>
cat &gt; filename &#x2026; and then paste slowly into it from the Mac's
effectively-infinite pasteboard.  Doesn't work well for non-text, but
that's not much of a problem, honestly.
</p>

<p>
I wanted something slightly less janky.
</p>

</section>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org65822a9">UUCP</h3>
<p>
Before there was universal TCP/IP, there was UUCP.  Designed for dialup,
batch file transfer.  This is kind of perfect for what I needed.
</p>

<p>
I followed the guide at
<a href="https://github.com/jwbrase/pdp11-tools/blob/master/howtos/V7%20UUCP%20Installation%20Guide.pdf">UUCP
for v7</a> and now have a reasonable way to move files from the Pi host
(which of course is a completely-modern Linux system) to v7, and vice
versa.  It's extremely slow, but what do I care?
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org6e05e2b">Verdict</h3>
<p>
You wouldn't WANT to use it, but&#x2026;v7 is still much more pleasant than
DOS or Windows 3.x.  If you really want to use a Unix on a PDP-11,
though, NetBSD 2.11 is pretty much a fully-baked BSD, with a TCP/IP
stack and vi and everything.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org94ef082">Other stuff</h3>
<p>
I'm working on getting a DECNet Phase IV (over IP) cluster going between
a real VAX, a real Alpha, an emulated VAX, and an emulated Alpha.
</p>

<p>
Also trying to get a real Unix installed on a real VAXStation 4000vlc.
It will probably be NetBSD.
